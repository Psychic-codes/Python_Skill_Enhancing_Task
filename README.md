## Python Tasks

### a. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Write a program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of two numbers provided by the user.

### b. Palindrome Checker
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.

### c. File Handling
Create a script to read a text file, count the number of words, and write the results to a new file.

### d. Data Structures: Lists and Dictionaries
Write a program that stores student data (name, age, grades) in a dictionary and performs CRUD operations.

### e. Basic OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
Create a `Student` class with attributes for name, age, and grades. Include methods to display details and calculate the average grade.

### f. API Request
Use the `requests` library to fetch data from a public API (e.g., JSONPlaceholder, Weather API, Quotes API). Parse and display specific information.

## API Development Task Using Flask

### a. Objective
Implement a RESTful API using Flask and create a frontend interface to interact with the API.

### b. Requirements

#### i. Implement CRUD operations
1. **Create (POST)**: Add new entries.
2. **Retrieve (GET)**: Fetch existing entries.
3. **Update (PUT)**: Modify existing entries.
4. **Delete (DELETE)**: Remove entries.

#### ii. Design a topic for your API

Examples:
- A task management system (e.g., To-do List).
- A movie review database.
- A library system to manage books.
- Any other custom topic.

#### iii. Build a Frontend
Design a frontend interface using HTML/CSS/JavaScript or directly integrate it within Flask to interact with the API.

## Machine Learning Project

### a. Objective
Develop a Regression Model using any regression algorithm (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor).

### b. Steps

#### i. Dataset Selection
Choose a dataset (e.g., housing prices, student grades, or car sales data).

#### ii. Train and Evaluate
Train a regression model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.

#### iii. Export Model to Flask
Export the trained model and create a Flask API to serve predictions.

#### iv. Build Frontend for Predictions
Design a frontend to take user input for predictions and display results.
